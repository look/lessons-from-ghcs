# Lessons from Building GitHub Code Search

This is the repository for [my talk from Strange Loop 2023](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2023/lessons-from-building-github-code-search.html). After the conference, I'll update this with more information. In the meanwhile, [give code search a try](https://github.com/search)!
